# CS210-Programming-Languages-2025 Project 3
Project 3 of CS 210 focused on Grocery Produce Tracking. Corner Grocery Store wanted to rearrange its produce section based on consumer sales of each item. It was the goal of the store to make shopping more efficient for customers, and the tracker would allow management to see the top selling produce of the store. 

**What did you do particularly well?**
I took a more basic route to allow the store to get the key data that they needed.Instead of overcomplicating things, I just made sure the program gave straightforward data on produce sales. I also made sure the inputs worked correctly so the results were reliable every time.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
If I had more time, I would have added stronger input checks so the program can handle mistakes better. Also, I missed out on using colored fonts to highlight different produce items. Adding color would have made the output easier to read and help managers quickly spot top sellers. 

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
The most challenging part for me was learning how to use maps in C++. At first, I struggled with the logic of storing items as keys and tracking their counts as values. However, after spending more time with the course materials of how maps worked, everything else in the project became much easier.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
My biggest takeaway was learning how to use maps effectively. Since that was my most challenging concept, finally understanding it gave me a tool that I can easily use to tackle larger data sets. 

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I tried to write the code in a way that was clearand easy to follow for those that may not know programming language. By including variable names, adding comments, and keeping the format consistent, I was able to develop a program that would give the grocery store valuable information on tailoring its store to match the sales flow of products.
